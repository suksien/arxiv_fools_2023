Working abstract:
Publications, and the ensuing citations, are currency for academics. As such, we try every possible ways to attract people to our papers admist the deluge of 60+ papers that appear on the arxiv each day. One popular way is to employ pop-culture cheeky paper titles. In this groundbreaking work, we investigate the trend of cheeky titles with time and their correlations with author demographics. We also investigate how effective these cheeky titles are in garnering citations. We conclude by asking the future of ...err everything, aka AI, to rank what it thinks are the top 5 cheekiest titles.
